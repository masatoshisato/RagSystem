This code is a Bicep template designed to create an Azure Resource Group with specific tags. Below is a detailed description of the code and its components:

### Description
The Bicep template is used to create an Azure Resource Group with predefined tags. These tags include information about the managing department, the resource owner, the creation date, and the deployment name. The template defines several parameters to customize the resource group and its tags.

### Target Scope
The target scope for this deployment is set to the subscription level, indicating that the resource group will be created within a specified Azure subscription.

```bicep
targetScope = 'subscription'
```

### Parameters
The template defines several parameters to specify the resource group's location, name, and tags.

1. **_rgLocation**: The Azure region where the resource group will be created. Default is set to 'japaneast'.
   ```bicep
   @description('Common Region for the resources that are created by this template.')
   param _rgLocation string = 'japaneast'
   ```

2. **_rgName**: The name of the resource group to be created. This is a mandatory parameter.
   ```bicep
   @description('Resource group name that you will create.')
   param _rgName string
   ```

3. **_tagDeptName**: The department managing the resources. Default is 'iocc'.
   ```bicep
   @description('The managing department name of the resources. This value is put on a tag.')
   param _tagDeptName string = 'iocc'
   ```

4. **_tagOwnerName**: The owner of the resources. Default is 'iocc_sato'.
   ```bicep
   @description('The managing owner name of the resources. This value is put on a tag.')
   param _tagOwnerName string = 'iocc_sato'
   ```

5. **_tagUtcShort**: The creation date of the resources, formatted as "dd/MM/yyyy". This is dynamically set to the current date.
   ```bicep
   @description('Created date of the resources. Formatted as "dd/MM/yyyy". This value is put on a tag.')
   param _tagUtcShort string = utcNow('d')
   ```

6. **_tagDeploymentName**: The deployment name specified during the deployment of the resources. This is dynamically set to the current deployment's name.
   ```bicep
   @description('The deployment name specified when the resources are deployed. This value is put on a tag.')
   param _tagDeploymentName string = deployment().name
   ```

### Resources
The template defines a single resource group with the specified parameters and tags.

```bicep
resource newRG 'Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2022-09-01' = {
  name: _rgName
  location: _rgLocation
  tags: {
    dept: _tagDeptName
    owner: _tagOwnerName
    lastDeployed: _tagUtcShort
    deploy: _tagDeploymentName
  }
}
```

- **name**: The name of the resource group, as provided by the `_rgName` parameter.
- **location**: The region where the resource group will be created, as specified by the `_rgLocation` parameter.
- **tags**: A set of tags applied to the resource group, including department, owner, creation date, and deployment name.

### Summary
This Bicep template facilitates the creation of an Azure Resource Group with specified tags that include management and deployment details. The parameters allow for customization of the resource group's name, location, and tag values, while the use of dynamic parameters ensures the inclusion of current deployment information.
